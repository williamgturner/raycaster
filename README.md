# Raycast Renderer
A simple raycasting renderer written in C using the SDL2 library.

## Dependencies
SDL2 is required, homebrew installs to /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2 however I could not get this to work so it should instead be manually installed to /Library/Frameworks. The makefile will likely need to be edited to work on Windows/Linux.

## Build Instructions

make all

## Devlog
Here are a collection of progress images to show how the renderer developed.
