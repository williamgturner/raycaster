# Raycast Renderer
A simple raycasting renderer written in C using the SDL2 library

## Dependencies
SDL2 is required, homebrew installs to /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2 however I could not get this to work so it should instead be manually installed to /Library/Frameworks

## Build Instructions
'''shell
make clean
make build
make run
'''
